Self taught software developer🖥️. I love working on intresting complex algorithims and hacking(the legal kind of course, sometimes 👀), prefere low level / middle level / low high level coding (depending on how much of a bada** you are. with c/c++ devs being most bada** and js devs being least(sorry guys🙇)) and not a fan of
unnessesary technologies. My tech stack include Nim, Python, JavaScript and Dart.

- Find a simple solution to a complex problem (By every old IT guy out there😄)
- Try to always work with the std library, only import third party libraries if you have to or if you're feeling lazy (By an old wise C-NERD💆)
